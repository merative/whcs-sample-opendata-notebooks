# IBM Watson Health COVID-19 Notebooks

This github repository contains sample Jupyter notebooks that are provided in response to the COVID19 crisis.

The [**iml-covid-19_sample**]() notebook demonstrates how to use **IBM Watson Insights for Medical Literature** to interface with an enriched covid-19 corpus. Various experiments are provided showing different methods for understanding and querying the corpora.  The various experiments have supporting documentation in the notebook.

The [**COVID-19 Processed Literature Notebook**](https://github.com/IBM/whcs-sample-opendata-notebooks/tree/master/covid19-processed-literature-notebook) is provided as-is. It is intended to be an example notebook that users such as data scientists can use or build upon to perform analysis against the raw data files produced by the Annotator for Clinical Data enrichment process.
