# IBM Watson Health COVID-19 Notebooks

**Deprecated**

This github repository contains sample Jupyter notebooks that are provided in response to the COVID19 crisis.

The [**COVID-19 Processed Literature Notebook**](https://github.com/IBM/whcs-sample-opendata-notebooks/tree/master/covid19-processed-literature-notebook) is provided as-is. It is intended to be an example notebook that users such as data scientists can use or build upon to perform analysis against the raw data files produced by the **Annotator for Clinical Data** enrichment process.
